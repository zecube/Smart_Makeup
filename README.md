# Real-time Makeup Experience

First, we utilize the Mediapipe and dlib libraries to accurately recognize each part of the user's face. Then, using OpenCV, we separate individual layers like skin, lips, and eyes.

On these isolated layers, we apply scikit-learn's sophisticated color histogram matching technique to naturally transform them into the desired shades. Finally, we integrate the transformed layers to render a lifelike made-up look for the user. Most importantly, this entire process happens in real-time, providing an immersive experience akin to looking in a mirror.

To make the makeup experience even more personalized and intuitive, users can utilize the smart vanity's touch UI. With just a few simple steps, you can craft the perfect makeup look.

First, touch the area of the face you want to apply makeup to on the UI.

Second, tap through the various color options to find your ideal shade.

Third, easily adjust the opacity to control how intense or sheer you want the makeup application.

Finally, for features like blush or eyebrows, you can freely modify the default placement if desired.

This step-by-step process allows you to fully customize your perfect makeup according to your preferences. The touch interactions with the vanity UI make creating makeup looks fun and creative.
